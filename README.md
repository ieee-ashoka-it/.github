Our mission is to help fellow student members acquire indispensable skills that set them apart from those vying for prestigious positions in business and academics by providing various service programmes and leadership training. At Ashoka University a society like IASB presents a unique opportunity to cater to a student community from various academic backgrounds. With our flagship hands-on lab sessions coupled with an earnest attempt to increase technological literacy in the community at large we look forward to providing scientific exposure that leads to the development of an enthusiastic and inclusive STEM audience.
